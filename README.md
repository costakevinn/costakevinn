## Projects

* **GPredict** – Machine learning tool for **Gaussian Process Regression**. Learns nonlinear patterns, models predictive uncertainty, and generates prior/posterior visualizations along with error-aware forecasts.
  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/costakevinn/GPredict)

> Demonstrates practical skills in **machine learning, regression, Gaussian processes, uncertainty quantification, and Python-based predictive modeling**.



* **ProbNN** – Probabilistic **Neural Network** for regression with heteroscedastic uncertainty. Implements a neural architecture with dual output heads (predictive mean and variance) trained via Gaussian Negative Log-Likelihood, enabling uncertainty-aware regression, stable learning on noisy data, and robust modeling of nonlinear, multi-scale, and discontinuous functions.
